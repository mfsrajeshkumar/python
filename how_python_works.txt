Absolutely Rajesh! 💻🔥 You're now touching the heart of how Python works under the hood — something most engineers skip, but mastering it gives you a lead-level understanding.

Let’s go step by step — from the moment you type print("Hello") in a Python file, to what your machine actually does.
🧠 Big Picture Flow: From Code to Execution

You write:          print("Hello")
          ↓
Python Parser:      Reads and converts it to tokens
          ↓
Compiler:           Converts tokens to bytecode (.pyc)
          ↓
Python VM (PVM):    Executes bytecode using interpreter (CPython by default)
          ↓
Your screen:        Hello

🔍 Now Let's Break This Deeply
✅ 1. Python Installation

    When you install Python (e.g., sudo apt install python3), you're installing:

        The interpreter (CPython),

        The standard library,

        Tools like pip, python, and python3.

✅ 2. You Write a Program

Example: hello.py

print("Hello")

This is just plain text until Python processes it.
✅ 3. Python Parser: Lexical Analysis

When you run:

python hello.py

The interpreter:

    Reads your code line by line

    Tokenizes the code (e.g., print, (, "Hello", ) are tokens)

    Checks for syntax errors

✅ 4. Compiler: Converts to Bytecode

If the syntax is valid:

    Python compiles your .py file to an intermediate form called bytecode.

    This bytecode is platform-independent and stored in .pyc files inside __pycache__/.

Example:

__pycache__/hello.cpython-311.pyc

    💡 Python does not compile to machine code like C. It compiles to bytecode.

✅ 5. Python Virtual Machine (PVM) Executes Bytecode

    This is the interpreter loop.

    It reads one bytecode instruction at a time and executes it.

    This is done by the CPython runtime (written in C).

So in your case:

    It sees the bytecode for print("Hello")

    Calls the print function from built-in namespace

    Sends "Hello" to the output stream (stdout)

✅ 6. You See the Output

Hello

🎉 This is the final result of many steps — most of which are invisible unless you go deep.

🛠 Real-World Analogy
You Do	Behind the Scenes
Type code	Like writing a recipe
Run it	The chef (PVM) reads the recipe
Get output	Food is cooked and served (your output!)
🧪 Want to See Internals?

You can use Python tools to peek under the hood:
Disassemble to see bytecode:

import dis

def greet():
    print("Hello")

dis.dis(greet)

Output:

  2           0 LOAD_GLOBAL              0 (print)
              2 LOAD_CONST               1 ('Hello')
              4 CALL_FUNCTION            1
              6 RETURN_VALUE

🧠 Key Terms Summary
Term	Meaning
Tokenizer	Breaks code into words/symbols (tokens)
Parser	Builds structure (syntax tree)
Bytecode	Low-level portable instructions
PVM	Python’s engine that runs bytecode
CPython	Default Python implementation (written in C)
✅ Final Summary

    When you run a Python program, you're not just "running code" — you're triggering a multi-stage pipeline involving parsing, compilation to bytecode, and interpretation by the Python Virtual Machine.
