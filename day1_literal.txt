✅ Literal: "Written Directly"

This means you didn’t calculate it or fetch it from somewhere — you just typed it in.
🔸 Example (Literal):

x = 10

    10 is a literal.

    You typed the number 10 directly.

    Python sees it and understands: "Ah, the programmer means the number ten."

🔁 Reverse: "Not Written Directly" (Calculated or From Variable)
🔹 Example 1: Expression (not a literal)

x = 5 + 5

Here:

    5 + 5 is an expression, not a literal.

    The result (10) is calculated by Python, not directly written by you.

🔹 Example 2: Function call

x = int("10")

    "10" is a string literal.

    But int("10") is an evaluation, not a literal.

🔹 Example 3: Variable

y = 10
x = y

    10 is a literal.

    y is a variable.

    x = y uses a value from memory, not a literal.

🔄 Summary
Situation	Literal?	Why?
x = 10	✅ Yes	You typed the number directly
x = 5 + 5	❌ No	It's calculated
x = int("10")	❌ No	It's converted from another type
x = y	❌ No	Getting from a variable
x = "Hello"	✅ Yes	You typed the string directly
🎯 Simple Definition Again:

    A literal is a fixed value that you directly type into your code — not a variable, not a result, not a calculation.
