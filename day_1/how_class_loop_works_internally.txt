✅ Part 1: How Classes and Objects Work Internally in Python
🧠 First, What Is a Class?

A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes, each with their own data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
🔍 When You Define a Class

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

Internally:

    Python creates a class object.

    The name Person points to this class object in the global namespace.

    __init__ is just a regular function inside the class object.

🛠 Class Object in Memory

When you define class Person, Python does this:

    Calls the built-in type() function to create the class.

    Creates a dictionary (__dict__) to store class attributes and methods.

    Registers the class in the current namespace.

You can confirm:

print(type(Person))        # <class 'type'>
print(Person.__dict__)     # Shows all methods/attributes

📦 When You Create an Object

p = Person("Rajesh")

Internally:

    Python calls the class like a function: Person(...)

    This calls the class’s __new__() method → creates a blank object.

    Then it calls __init__() → initializes the object.

    Object p is returned and stored in memory.

print(type(p))  # <class '__main__.Person'>
print(p.__dict__)  # {'name': 'Rajesh'}

🧠 Behind the Scenes – Object Memory Model

Each object stores:

    A reference to its class (__class__)

    A dictionary of its own data (__dict__)

    Methods are not copied into each object; they are shared via the class.

✅ Summary of Class-Object Flow
Action	Internal Behavior
Class defined	type() creates a class object
Object created	__new__ allocates memory, __init__ initializes
Object accessed	Attributes first searched in instance, then in class
Methods called	Bound methods → self is automatically passed
✅ Part 2: How Loops and Control Structures Work Internally
🔁 for Loop

for item in [1, 2, 3]:
    print(item)

Internally:

    Python gets an iterator from the object: [1, 2, 3].__iter__()

    It repeatedly calls __next__() on the iterator.

    Each value is assigned to item.

    Stops when StopIteration is raised.

So, it’s iterator-based, not index-based like C.
🔄 while Loop

x = 3
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1

Internally:

    Python evaluates the condition: x > 0

    If true → execute body

    After each cycle → re-check condition

    If false → exit loop

The loop is managed by a loop block in bytecode.
🧠 break, continue, and else (yes, else with loop!)

for i in range(3):
    if i == 1:
        break
else:
    print("Loop finished normally")

    break: exits the loop early

    continue: skips to next iteration

    else: runs only if the loop was not broken

🔧 Bytecode Under the Hood

You can see what Python is doing at the bytecode level:

import dis

def loop():
    for i in range(2): print(i)

dis.dis(loop)

You’ll see:

    GET_ITER

    FOR_ITER

    STORE_FAST

    CALL_FUNCTION

This is the Python Virtual Machine executing loop instructions.
📌 Combined Summary
Feature	What Happens Internally
Class definition	Creates a class object using type()
Object creation	Calls __new__ → __init__
for loop	Uses iterator protocol (__iter__ / __next__)
while loop	Evaluates condition every iteration
break / continue	Alters the loop flow
Loop else	Runs if loop completes without break
